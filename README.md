# bing-desktop-updater
Updates the desktop background from Bing Desktop without installing the desktop client

# Installation

1. Download and build the solution
2. Create a Scheduled Task in Windows and configure to run `\Updater\bin\Debug\NfnProductions.BingDesktopUpdater.Updater.exe` on workstation unlock and at login. Perhaps even nightly if you don't lock your workstation

That's it. Each day, you should have the Bing Desktop as you wallpaper and you don't have that stupid client to contend with!
